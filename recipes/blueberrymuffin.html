        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This easy blueberry muffin recipe is an Epicurious classic. The muffins are slightly sweet, but not so sweet you’d mistake them for cupcakes, and chock-full of fresh blueberries. (You can use frozen blueberries, too. Just don’t thaw them before folding them in, or you risk soggy muffins.) The batter has a bit of sour cream, giving the muffins a very tender crumb and a gentle tang. Before baking, you’ll add a pinch of coarse sugar to the top of the muffins to gild them with a shimmery, crunchy dome. The result: the best blueberry muffins we’ve ever had.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups granulated sugar</li>
            <li>2 tsp. baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp. kosher salt</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
            <li>1/2 cup whole milk</li>
            <li>1 tsp. vanilla extract</li>
            <li>3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, melted</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups blueberries (about 8 ounces)</li>
            <li>3 Tbsp. coarse sugar</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375°F. Line muffin pan with liners. Whisk flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Whisk eggs, sour cream, milk, and vanilla in a medium bowl.</li>
            <li>Mix egg mixture into dry ingredients, then stir in butter. Fold in blueberries.</li>
            <li>Divide batter among muffin cups, filling to the brim (about ½ cup batter per muffin). Sprinkle with coarse sugar.</li>
            <li>Bake muffins, rotating pan halfway through, until golden brown and a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 28–33 minutes.</li>
            <li>Let cool in pan 5 minutes, then transfer muffins to a wire rack and let cool completely.
                <p><strong>Do Ahead:</strong> Muffins can be made 3 days ahead. Transfer to an airtight container and store at room temperature, or freeze up to 2 months.</p> </li>
        </ol>
